## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and are crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. This repository serves as a log of my progress in learning DSA using Java and practicing on LeetCode.

## Learning Resources

I'm following the following resources to learn DSA with Java:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/): A platform for practicing coding problems, including algorithmic challenges.
- [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/): A valuable resource for learning DSA concepts with clear explanations and examples.
- [Coursera - Algorithms Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms): A comprehensive course series by Stanford University.

Feel free to explore these resources along with me on my learning journey!

In the `src` directory, you can organize your Java code for solving LeetCode problems. The `main` directory contains your solution files, while the `test` directory is for writing test cases.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/leetcode-dsa-java.git
   ```
